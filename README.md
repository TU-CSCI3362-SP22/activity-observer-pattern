# Observer Activity

This activity is designed to be completed in groups of 1-3. Phase 1 involves familiarizing yourself with the existing code base and add features. In Phase 2 we will cover the observer pattern in the abstract. In Phase 3 you will implement the observer pattern.

## Phase 1 - Implement an Alert Box 
    1) In the AlertBox class, create methods tempAlert, humidityAlert, pressureAlert
       - Each method sets it's given variable (tempAlert sets the AlertBox's instance variable temperarute..etc) 
       - Each method sets a threshold for the alert
       - Each method prints an alert to transcript if the threshold is met 
    2) Change setTemperature, setHumidity, setPressure to call corresponding AlertBox method (setTemp calls tempAlert...etc) 
        -Note: Ignore the fact that each of these methods create a random number, this is just for the sake of getting different data each time. 

## Phase 2 - What is the Observer Pattern (why the old code is whack) 

## Phase 3 - Implement the Observer Pattern
